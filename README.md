## Hexagonal Demo

I created this hexagonal *Game of Life* demo to show that this package generalizes the *Game of Life* in any of its variations.

## Idea

On May 30th, 2015, I participated in a [Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/) at Milan XPUG.

We had so much fun coding implementations of the [Game of Life][1].

As a mathematician, I think it is a very interesting problem. I couldn't resist generalizing it and trying to solve it in any of its variations.

Let's start with some abstractions.

The function *getNeighboursOf*, which returns the set of cells adjacent to a given cell, defines the shape of a *Game of Life* universe.

In fact, since

    getNeighboursOf(cell1) = getNeighboursOf(cell2) â‡’ cell1 = cell2

it can be said that the set of neighbours of a cell is dual to the cell itself, hence the definition of the *getNeighboursOf* function is equivalent to the definition of the space of a *Game of Life* universe. Note that it defines the concept of **nearness**.

In other words,

> if you define a *getNeighbours* function you also shape the space of a *Game of Life* universe

On the other hand, given the definition of an *isAlive* function, which returns `true` if the given cell is alive, `false` otherwise.
It can be easily extended to an *areAlive* function, which, given a list of cells, returns a list of booleans; following similar reasoning to what we used for the *getNeighboursOf* function, an *isAlive* function describes the state of a *Game of Life* universe at a given moment.

The considerations above allow us to implement an **abstract** *Game of Life* in a functional way, in any of its variations, for example:

* finite grid
* infinite grid
* 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, n-dimensional
* square, triangular, hexagonal tiles
* cylinder, torus, moebius strip, boy surface

## Example

A simple example is the [infinite grid with two dimensional coordinates](https://github.com/fibo/games-of-life/blob/main/examples/infiniteGrid2d/infiniteGrid2d_test.js).

Define the *infiniteGrid2d* function which returns the neighbours of a given cell.

```javascript
function infiniteGrid2d ([x, y]) {
  const neighbours = []

  for (let j = y - 1; j <= y + 1; j++) {
    for (let i = x - 1; i <= x + 1; i++) {
      if ((i === x) && (j === y))
        continue

      neighbours.push([i, j])
    }
  }

  return neighbours
}
```

Create a *Game of Life* world and get the *evolve* function

```javascript
import { createWorld, classicTransitionRule } from 'games-of-life'

const world = createWorld(infiniteGrid2d)
const transitionRule = classicTransitionRule.bind(null, 2, 3, 3)

const evolve = world(transitionRule)
```

The empty grid is represented by a function that always returns false, so

```javascript
function emptyGrid () {
  return false
}

evolve(emptyGrid) // will always return false
```

Try with a single cell at the origin

```javascript
function singleCellAtTheOrigin (cell) {
  return ((cell[0] === 0) && (cell[1] === 0))
}

evolve(singleCellAtTheOrigin) // will always return false too, because the cell dies
```

Now, a more interesting example is the blinker

<!-- original file was https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Game_of_life_blinker.gif -->
![Blinker](https://fibo.github.io/games-of-life/examples/infiniteGrid2d/blinker.gif)

```javascript
function horizontalBlinker ([x, y]) {
  if (y !== 0) {
    return false
  }

  if ((x >= -1) && (x <= 1)) {
    return true
  }

  return false
}

function verticalBlinker ([x, y]) {
  if (x !== 0) {
    return false
  }

  if ((y >= -1) && (y <= 1)) {
    return true
  }

  return false
}
```

You may check that the *verticalBlinker* evolves into the *horizontalBlinker* and vice versa

```javascript
for (let i = -1; i < 1; i++) {
  for (let j = -1; j < 1; j++) {
    console.log(evolve(verticalBlinker)(i, j) ===  horizontalBlinker(i, j)) // true
  }
}
```
